#Store, Inventory, and Habit Game

Practice Project for learning purposes

The goal of this project was to create a sort of game that rewards the player for doing real world tasks or habits

Currently the project has a Main menu from which you can do a few things, go to the store, check your inventory, manage your daily tasks, or exit. It asks for the user to type what they want to do.

If c is typed then the player can create a new task to add to their list of to dos
if s is typed the player goes to a store where they can buy items (only item is a potion) if they have the money
if i is typed the player sees their inventory, and can choose to use any items they have
if d is typed the player can mark their daily task done
if e is typed all changed variables are saved to txt files and program is exited

IN ORDER TO SAVE YOUR PROGRESS YOU MUST TYPE E TO EXIT!!!
