# pythonfinalproject
my final for my intro to python class
right now it just displays the menu and has some of the classes outlined. It exits when you hit e, and I S or D will show you Inventory, Store, and Daily tasks. Right now it doesn't actually carry out those tasks just prints "Store" or "Inventory". Some of the classes have been outlined but not ready to implement into the current program yet.
